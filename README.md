# Dot Files

This git repo serves as my personal storage of all my dot files. It is an easy method for me to install the required files I may need on a new system easily.

To set up run the following command to set up a symmlink for the ./bash_profile (if cloned elsewhere edit the ~./dotfiles/.* throughout repo)

```bash
ln -s ~/dotfiles/.bash_profile ~/.bash_profile
```
